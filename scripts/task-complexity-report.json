      "taskTitle": "Implement selectedDate State Management",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of selectedDate state management into specific subtasks covering initialization, synchronization with dateFilter, update handlers, and testing",
      "reasoning": "This task involves state management which has moderate complexity due to the need to synchronize with existing state. It requires careful consideration of component architecture but doesn't involve complex algorithms."

      "taskTitle": "Update Data Filtering Logic",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data filtering logic update into subtasks covering refactoring the filteredReadings logic, implementing date range calculations, optimizing performance, adding caching, and testing the filtering mechanism",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves refactoring existing logic, implementing date calculations, and considering performance optimizations like caching. The data filtering is a core functionality that affects the entire application."

      "taskTitle": "Add Navigation Controls UI",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the navigation controls UI implementation into subtasks for creating the chevron buttons, implementing the date display, styling according to design language, and ensuring responsive layout",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a UI implementation task with moderate complexity. It involves creating new UI elements, styling them, and implementing basic conditional logic for button states, but doesn't involve complex state management."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Date Navigation Logic",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the date navigation logic implementation into subtasks covering increment/decrement handlers, validation logic, UI update mechanisms, and testing the navigation flow",
      "reasoning": "This task connects UI controls to state management with moderate complexity. It requires implementing handlers, validation logic, and ensuring smooth state transitions, but follows standard patterns for UI interaction."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Add Date Picker for Quick Navigation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the date picker implementation into subtasks for creating the tappable date display, implementing the date picker component, connecting it to state management, styling for platform consistency, and testing the selection flow",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a date picker involves moderate complexity due to the need to follow platform conventions, handle date selection logic, and integrate with existing state management. It may also require third-party component integration."

      "taskTitle": "Add 'Today' Button for Quick Return",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Today' button implementation into subtasks for creating the button UI, implementing the reset logic, handling conditional visibility, and testing the functionality",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively simple feature with low complexity. It involves adding a single button with straightforward logic to reset the date to today and conditional rendering based on the current state."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Swipe Gesture Navigation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the swipe gesture navigation into subtasks for implementing gesture recognizers, connecting to navigation logic, calibrating sensitivity, adding visual feedback, and testing across different devices",
      "reasoning": "Gesture implementation has higher complexity due to the need to handle touch events, calibrate sensitivity, provide visual feedback, and ensure consistent behavior across different devices and screen sizes."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Add Visual Feedback and Transitions",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the visual feedback implementation into subtasks for creating slide animations, implementing visual distinctions for historical data, ensuring consistent graph scaling, optimizing performance, and testing on different devices",
      "reasoning": "Animation and transition work has higher complexity due to performance considerations, cross-device testing requirements, and the need to maintain visual consistency while adding dynamic elements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Handle Edge Cases and Error States",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down edge case handling into subtasks for implementing empty state UI, adding navigation boundary logic, implementing error handling for data loading, adding user feedback mechanisms, and comprehensive testing of edge conditions",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate to high complexity because it requires identifying and handling multiple edge cases and error states. Comprehensive testing is needed to ensure all scenarios are covered properly."
